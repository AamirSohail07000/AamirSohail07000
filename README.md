Hi, I’m Aamir. I’m currently working as a Talent Acquisition professional,
but I am transitioning to a backend development role, driven by my passion for coding and web development.

I’m learning Backend development and my skills include:

-HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
-Java, Python (Django, Flask)
-MySQL, GitHub
Currently, I’m focusing on Python, Django, and Flask, and I’m working on various projects to apply and deepen my knowledge.
Looking ahead, I plan to expand my expertise by learning Spring, Spring Boot, and React, aiming for a career in full stack development.
I’m eager to collaborate on projects that will allow me to utilize my learnings and gain valuable experience.
